Fight 'til the end of me, 'til the end of me
Did you think that it would be that easy?
This ain't a tragedy, a tr-tr-tragedy
I'm not going six feet in the ground
It's not a fever dream, it's reality
Cut me open and my heart's still beating
Healed from my injuries, now I'm on my feet
I'm not going six feet in the ground
'Cause I believe underneath
I won't ever lose composure
No defeat, won't retreat
Hold the line until it's over
All my scars are tattoos, they're a work of art
I believe, underneath
I was born to be a soldier
Reaching for my destiny
Goodbye to my enemies
Goodbye to my enemies
Goodbye to my enemies
